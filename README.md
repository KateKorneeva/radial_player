Circle Player
=============

This project represents a player with dynamical playlists.

The player itself is designen in a circle shape. It has loader, showing how much of a song is already played. 
Position of loader is adjustable.  The idea of implementation of a circle loader is taken from this nice article https://medium.com/@andsens/radial-progress-indicator-using-css-a917b80c43f9.

Playlists are separated into albums. Switching to composition in playlist can be done by clicking.

List of albums is displayed in accordeon, so that user can see, whish album he is on currently.
